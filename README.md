Payment systems are now available everywhere and everyone interacts with these systems every day.  <br>There are different types of transactions you can make, SALE, REFUND, Pre-Authorization, and VOID. <br> <br>SALE: means to buy something and its price will be deducted from your bank account. <br>REFUND: this means that you will return something and wants your money back to your bank account. <br>Pre-Authorization: means holding an amount of money from your account, e.g Hotel reservation. <br>VOID: this means canceling the transaction, e.g if the seller entered the wrong amount.  <br> <br>You are required to implement the SALE transaction only by simulating the card, terminal(ATM), and the server.
